# Example Extension

This is an example extension that shows how to include additional python packages in your extension
using the `pyproject.toml` file.

Consider that such extensions can only be installed by instance using
[poetry](https://docs.lnbits.org/guide/installation.html#option-1-recommended-poetry) as their package manager.
